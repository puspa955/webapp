                    Here, we present<span className='font-bold ' > GPTNepal </span>which is QA webapp for tourists who want to visit Nepal and are looking for insights for the places
                    they want to visit in Nepal. They can gain information for the places they want to visit at one location i.e. at our webapp.
                    We have built our webapp using the latest cutting edge technology called <span className='font-bold'> transformers </span> which is primarily built for NLP
                    tasks. We have used the <span className='font-bold  ' > pre-trained GPT-2 model of Hugging Face </span>. GPT-2 is a large transformer-based language model
                    with 1.5 billion parameters, trained on a dataset of 8 million web pages. GPT-2 is trained with a simple objective: predict
                    the next word, given all of the previous words within some text. The diversity of the dataset causes this simple goal to
                    contain naturally occurring demonstrations of many tasks across diverse domains. GPT-2 is a direct scale-up of GPT, with
                    more than 10X the parameters and trained on more than 10X the amount of data.
